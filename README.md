Roadmap to Future Improvements

An important feature I'd like to implement into my Tic-Tac-Toe game is user customization. For example, allowing users to be able to change their symbols (e.g diamonds, hearts), board size (e.g 3x3, 6x6), or amount of players. I would implement these features by coding different presets and allowing the user to be able to choose from a list in the menu/settings of the game. User customization is key to a successful game in my opinion, as more people are more likely to play a game with options rather than a set layout.Â
